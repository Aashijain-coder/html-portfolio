<h3> Hidden Love </h3>
<p> <h4>Content type:- C- Drama</h4>
I highly recommend watching this drama in your free time . I can rewatch it   many times.
You might forget all your worries while watching and will find this really consoling . </p>
<hr>
<h3>Put your head on my shoulder</h3>
<p>  <h4>Content type:-  C-Drama</h4>
This is the first ever drama that i watched. I used to rewatch it all the time ,since i thought there were no drama comparable to this one, gradually i find out there were. Still this ones still my favorite .The artists did a great job , and i was so influenced by the nerdy male lead .</p>
<hr>
<h3> True beauty</h3>
<h4>Content type:- K-Drama</h4>
<p> This is a really good content ,to watch in order to get relaxed. The best thing about this drama is that people are prone to love the second lead Han Seojun more than the first lead. (i am not exception, even though i don't admit since i love the main lead the same). The love triangle , the dilemma , the story everything is phenomenal .</p>
<hr> 
<h3 > Master devil do not kiss me</h3>
<h4>Content type:-  C-Drama</h4>
<p> This is also one of the early drama's i watched .This is a hillarious drama mainly because of the egoistic character of the male lead , he had an amazing sense of humour . Here we see a pentagon type of situation instead of triangle.</p>
<hr> 
<h3> 
    My demon
</h3>
<h4>Content type:- K-Drama</h4>
<p> This is a very funny and insightful drama of a super natural creature . Loved watching the snippets from Chinese royal time . It was also fun to watch the handsome demon trying to adapt admist the mortal beings and ofcourse the chemistry between the demon and a human girl.LOl</p>

<h3> Good bad mother </h3>
<h4>Content type:-  K-Drama</h4>
<p> Oh my gawd! i highly recommend watching it . I loved it , even thought it was a roller coster of emotions .I couldnt bear to see their problems , separation and dilemma . The suspense it carried throughout was amazing .</p>
<hr>
<h3> 18 again</h3>
<h4>Content type:- K-Drama</h4>
<p> A really nice drama , the story and plotting was highly relatable . The dad is the main protagonist of the drama it was really fun to watch him getting adapted in the school with his children , being a teen again . At the same time it got me teared up to watch  parents giving up everything for their children and age becoming the major cause for them to not live their dreams when they are freed up from the responsibilities of their childern . It was really hillarious to watch the dad's new side .</p>

<h3 >Big bang theory </h3>
<h4>Content type:-Series</h4>
<p> I cant say in words, how much i love this series even though this is the parent series i watched its prequel first and was in two minds about this , but fortunately i took a chance and watched it . IT was so informative , so nice . I got used to the idiosyncracies of sheldon and the humour and on point comebacks. I love the friendship between all of them especially Sheldon and leonard , and sheldon and penny.  </p>
<hr >
<h3 > Young sheldon</h3>
<h4>Content type:-Series</h4>
<p> The younger version of sheldon has its own fandom . I love the whole Cooper family and their bond and quirks of sheldon are the cherry on the cake . I lOve Missy and Meemaw . The end is heart breaking though, the passing away of George along with the comeback of adult Sheldon and Amy .</p>

<h4>Content type:- C-Drama </h4>
<p> This is an amazing drama with loads of suspense which i really do not want to spoil here. My fellow readers, i recommend watching it asap and stop reading now. If u already have , go on.
    SO in this drama the girl always thought that she had accidentally time travelled and got into a different foeign universe , but only later she finds out that the world she wanted to go back to was never real but the result of her own imagination . Actually she was used as a lab rat for an ongoing experiment overtaken by some bad people .Her love rescues her then , who is a skilled detective .
